## Overview
Outliers are not an easy topic to learn, but we'll keep it simple here—we promise. In this app, you will learn:

- Three painless measurement methods to spot outliers
- When it is acceptable to remove an outlier from your regression model
- Alternative solutions for dealing with outliers


## Instructions

### 1. Identify Outliers
Click on the checkboxes to include and exclude outliers from the model. See how the regression line and coefficients change. Answer the multiple choice question to see if you've learned what you were meant to.

### 2. Measure Outliers
Click on each of the three measures to see easy-to-understand definitions and formulas. Then, look at the corresponding graphs to identify which observations are outliers.

Check your work by looking for labels on the graphs.

### 3. Solutions for Outliers
Now you know how to find outliers, but what should you do with them? Click on the checkboxes to find the correct answers. Remember — there is more than one correct solution, and some are better than others!

### 4. Quiz
Reinforce your knowledge of outliers with a quick 5-question quiz. All multiple choice, don't worry.
