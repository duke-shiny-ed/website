Duke ShinyEd is a program where students develop interactive apps to explore concepts for introductory and intermediate level statistics courses. It was inspired and modeled after the [ShinyEd](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mc301/shinyed/) project and the [Book of Apps for Statistics Teaching (BOAST)](https://sites.psu.edu/shinyapps/) at Penn State. 

The program was originally held over six weeks in Summer 2020 and continued in Spring 2021.
