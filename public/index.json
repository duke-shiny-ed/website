In the following three tabs the user will have the opportunity to conduct their very own ANOVA test.\n[STEP 1] The next tab, title \u0026ldquo;Step 1\u0026rdquo;, kicks off the ANOVA testing process. Here the user is introduced to the null and alternative hypotheses of the ANOVA test. The user can then manipulate the population datasets that will be used for the rest of the exploration. From there the user can progress to the next tab, \u0026ldquo;Step 2\u0026rdquo;.\n[STEP 2] On the \u0026ldquo;Step 2\u0026rdquo; tab random samples have been taken from the population data identified by the user on the previous (\u0026ldquo;Step 1\u0026rdquo;) tab. Here, users can manipulate the size of the samples drawn from each population. This tab also introduces that assumptions of the ANOVA test, and users are told whether or not these assumptions have been met and why under \u0026ldquo;ANOVA Assumptions\u0026rdquo; section. This is dependent on the user\u0026rsquo;s manipualtion of the population data during \u0026ldquo;Step 1\u0026rdquo; and their manipulation of the sample size.\nThe random samples are displayed graphically on this tab as boxplots. Users may interact with the graph to visulaize the boxplots in full, a visual representation of the within groups variances of the samples, or a visual representation of the between groups variance of the samples. The relevance of these are explored further on the next tab, \u0026ldquo;Step 3\u0026rdquo;.\n[STEP 3] The \u0026ldquo;Step 3\u0026rdquo; tab is concerned with reviewing the conclusion made by the ANOVA test regarding the population data identitfied by the user on the \u0026ldquo;Step 1\u0026rdquo; tab. Before receiving the conclusion, users are reminded of the hypotheses tested by ANOVA. Once again, the random samples from Step 2, whose variances are being analyzed by the ANOVA test on this tab, are displayed graphically as boxplots. Under the \u0026ldquo;What is the F-statistic\u0026rdquo; section users are introduced to the F-stat, its relationship to the within groups and between groups variances visualized on the \u0026ldquo;Step 2\u0026rdquo; tab, and how it will be used by ANOVA to reach the conclusion.\nFinally, the conclusion of the ANOVA test performed on the population data identified during Step 1 is highlighted. The conclusion is put in terms of the hypotheses (present on the Step 1 and Step 3 tabs), and users are also provided with a copy of the ANOVA test output you would expect when using the R programming language to conduct the same ANOVA test.\n[RESOURCES] The next tab, titled \u0026ldquo;Resources\u0026rdquo;, provided users with a copy of the equations relevant to ANOVA. Knowledge of these equations was not necessary in order to complete steps one through three. This page also gives more insight into how to interpret the R ANVOA test output seen on the Step 3 tab.\n[QUIZ] The final tab provides a short quiz for users practice some of the concepts reviewed throughout the app and to practice running an ANOVA test in R.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1daccb7a8c10e99697e935b73d9bd38e","permalink":"/project/anova/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/anova/","section":"project","summary":"Learn more about the ANOVA test process including which assumptions the test makes and the meaning behind the test conclusion.","tags":["regression"],"title":"Exlporing ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"To start, click on \u0026lsquo;See the app!\u0026rsquo; above: Outliers are not an easy topic to learn, but we\u0026rsquo;ll keep it simple here—we promise.

Hypothesis testing is a reliable way to take sample data and test how strongly its evidence supports our new claim \u0026ndash; if the evidence is strong, we can reject the old beliefs and support the new; if it is weak, we cannot reject the old beliefs.\nThis app will allow you to explore hypothesis testing from beginning to end, giving you skills to:\n Identify appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for a problem scenario, and effectively interpret test conclusions in terms of the hypotheses/practical scenario. Properly calculate and interpret test statistic, p-value, and alpha level, and understand how to use them to make a conclusion. Understand how sample size can affect test statistic and p-value. Correctly define and interpret Type I and Type II errors, and calculate their probabilities, given various parameters such as alpha, sample size, and testing power. Understand the conditions/assumptions under which each type of error may occur.  Instructions For the best experience with the Hypothesis Testing App, try following these steps:\n Check out the Overview page for a big-picture look at hypothesis testing, as well as the introduction of our running example and other small tips about the app\u0026rsquo;s functionality. Head to the Null/Alternative Hypotheses page to see the interactive sidebar and choose your parameters for your hypothesis test. Then, read about how the hypotheses are formed, and view the distributions graphically! Next, visit the Test Statistic/P-Value page to explore how to calculate the hypothesis test results, compare values to make a conclusion, and observe your results on a plot. Then, you can look at the Type I/Type II Error tab for an explanation of the kinds of errors that can occur in hypothesis tests and how to reduce them. Finally, take a quiz on the Quiz tab to test your knowledge and see if you\u0026rsquo;re a hypothesis test expert! Visit the Resources tab for some further reading if you\u0026rsquo;re interested.  You can reset parameters and re-run the hypothesis simulation at any time, so be sure to try out different scenarios to see what happens!\nCreated by Abbey List for the ShinyEd project at Duke University, Summer 2020.
