## Overview

In this app you will be able to explore Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). ANOVA is a method used in statistical analysis to question whether there is a meaningful difference between groups being studied.

### Learning Goals

1. Examine how violations of the assumptions of ANOVA affect the ANOVA test output

2. Understand the relationship between the F-statistic and the ANOVA test output

3. Predict how manipulation of between and within group variances will affect the F-statistic and the ANOVA test output
