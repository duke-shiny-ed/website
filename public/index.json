To acces the Exploring ANOVA app click See the app!\nAbout Page This first tab introduces the learning objectives the app seeks to address and offers a brief introduction to ANOVA. In the following three tabs users are given the opportunity to conduct their very own ANOVA test.\nStep 1 The next tab, titled \u0026ldquo;Step 1\u0026rdquo;, kicks off the ANOVA testing process. Here users are introduced to the null and alternative hypotheses of ANOVA. They may then choose the population data that will be used for the rest of the exploration by interacting with the various manipulators present. Once satisfied with their choices users may progress to the next step.\nStep 2 On the Step 2 tab, random samples have been taken from the population data chosen during Step 1. Here, the user may manipulate the sample size drawn from each population.\nThis tab also introduces the assumptions of the ANOVA test. Depending on the sample size and population data selected on the previous tab, users are told whether or not the assumptions have been met.\nThe random samples are displayed graphically on this tab as boxplots. Users may interact with the graph to visulaize the boxplots in full, a visual representation of the within groups variances of the samples, or a visual representation of the between groups variance of the samples. The relevance of these variances are explored further during the next step.\nStep 3 The Step 3 tab is concerned with reviewing the conclusion made by the ANOVA test on the population data selected by users during Step 1. Before receiving the conclusion, users are reminded of the hypotheses examined by ANOVA.\nUnder the \u0026ldquo;What is the F-statistic\u0026rdquo; section users are introduced to the F-stat, its relationship to the within groups and between groups variances visualized on the \u0026ldquo;Step 2\u0026rdquo; tab, and how it is used by ANOVA to reach the conclusion. Once again, the random samples from Step 2, are displayed graphically as boxplots for reference.\nFinally, the conclusion of the ANOVA test is presented. It is put in terms of the hypotheses users have examined, but users are also provided with a copy of the ANOVA test output they would expect were they to conduct the same test using the R programming language.\nResources Page This next tab provids users with a copy of some equations relevant to ANOVA. This page also gives more insight into how to interpret the ANVOA test output from R encountered during Step 3.\nQuiz Page This final tab provides a short assessment for users to practice running an ANOVA test in R snd review some of the concepts touched on throughout the app.\n The Exploring ANOVA app was created by Samantha Owusu-Antwi for Duke University\u0026rsquo;s Creating Interactive Learning Tools Project, Summer 2020.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1daccb7a8c10e99697e935b73d9bd38e","permalink":"/project/anova/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/anova/","section":"project","summary":"Learn more about the ANOVA test process including which assumptions the test makes and the meaning behind the test conclusion.","tags":["regression"],"title":"Exploring ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"To start, click on \u0026lsquo;See the app!\u0026rsquo; above: Outliers are not an easy topic to learn, but we\u0026rsquo;ll keep it simple here—we promise.

Hypothesis testing is a reliable way to take sample data and test how strongly its evidence supports our new claim \u0026ndash; if the evidence is strong, we can reject the old beliefs and support the new; if it is weak, we cannot reject the old beliefs.\nThis app will allow you to explore hypothesis testing from beginning to end, giving you skills to:\n Identify appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for a problem scenario, and effectively interpret test conclusions in terms of the hypotheses/practical scenario. Properly calculate and interpret test statistic, p-value, and alpha level, and understand how to use them to make a conclusion. Correctly define and interpret Type I and Type II errors, and calculate their probabilities, given various parameters such as alpha, sample size, and testing power. Understand the conditions/assumptions under which each type of error may occur.  Instructions The app is optimally viewed in full screen on the Google Chrome browser.

An important step in creating logistic regression models is choosing the appropriate threshold, which is done through the ROC Curve.\nIn this app you will:\n Identify the function of logistic regression* Select and understand ROC/AUC curves in logistic regression models Interpret a confusion matrix  App Walkthrough The Logistic Regression and ROC Curves App is best experienced through sequentially following the tabs on the left side bar, and from left to right within tabs that have that capability (\u0026lsquo;Logistic Regression\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;ROC Curve\u0026rsquo; tabs)\nWelcome Tab  Overview of the app with learning objectives Quick description of the dataset being used  Logistic Regression  The Logistic Regression Tab is made up of: Info, Data, and Model sub-tabs Info: First introduction to logistic regression, the situation one would use it in, and basic discussion of the output. The data is a bit more specified and you can see more in the.. Data: Scroll through entries in a table view; but you can see this put on a graph with the model in the\u0026hellip; Model: Observe see the data points from the previous tab in a graph with balance on the x axis and if the observation was default (1) or not default (0). Toggle the checkbox to see how the logistic model with a threshold of .5 categorizes the observation. Which observations are correctly predicted? How can you tell?  ROC Curve  What is ROC: This tab serves as an overview for the elements of an ROC Curve including axes and AUC. Notice where the threshold of .5 (which was used previously) is on the ROC Curve. Go to the next tab to see how the threshold from the model graph relates to the ROC Curve graph. Interaction: Scroll manually on the Threshold bar to change where the threshold lies on the model. Remember from the Logistic Regression tab how this determines the way the model predicts outcomes. See these predicted outcomes in real time with the confusion matrix on the bottom and how accurate the model is with the table on the right. You can also click the small green arrow on the Threshold button to animate the change of threshold and how it affects the confusion matrix and points on the ROC Curve!  Confusion Matrix  Now what does the confusion matrix actually show? See both the text definitions and the data points related to each types of predictions. These data points are dependent on the interaction from the previous tab! Play with different thresholds in the previous tab and notice how it affects different calculations related to the strength of the model including: accuracy, misclassification, sensitivity, and specificity. Use the buttons on the bottom to see how these values are calculated! Also notice trends between the ROC Curve and the rest of the table of values on this tab.  Quiz  Review your new knowledge with this multiple choice quiz! You can redo each question after submitting an answer individually.
