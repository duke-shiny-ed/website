It is inspired by the ShinyEd project and the Book of Apps for Statistics Teaching (BOAST) at Penn State. In a span of 6 weeks, students to develop interactive apps using R Shiny and conceptual assessments to help students again a more in-depth understanding of foundational statistical concepts.\nThe program was lead by faculty mentor Prof. Maria Tackett and project manager Anupriya Sivakumar. Undergraduate students Joe Choo, Abbey List, Glen Morgenstern, and Samantha Owusu-Antwi participated during Summer 2020.\nFor further information or questions please e-mail maria.tackett@duke.edu.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/","section":"authors","summary":"Duke ShinyEd is a program where students develop interactive apps to explore concepts for introductory and intermediate level statistics courses.

Hypothesis testing is a reliable way to take sample data and test how strongly its evidence supports our new claim \u0026ndash; if the evidence is strong, we can reject the old beliefs and support the new; if it is weak, we cannot reject the old beliefs.\nLearning Goals   Identify appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for a problem scenario, and effectively interpret test conclusions in terms of the hypotheses/practical scenario.\n  Calculate and interpret test statistic, p-value, and alpha level, and understand how to use them to make a conclusion.\n  Define and interpret Type I and Type II errors, and calculate their probabilities, given various parameters such as alpha, sample size, and testing power.
