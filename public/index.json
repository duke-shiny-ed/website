To acces the Exploring ANOVA app click See the app!\nAbout Page This first tab introduces the learning objectives the app seeks to address and offers a brief introduction to ANOVA. In the following three tabs users are given the opportunity to conduct their very own ANOVA test.\nStep 1 The next tab, titled \u0026ldquo;Step 1\u0026rdquo;, kicks off the ANOVA testing process. Here users are introduced to the null and alternative hypotheses of ANOVA. They may then choose the population data that will be used for the rest of the exploration by interacting with the various manipulators present. Once satisfied with their choices users may progress to the next step.\nStep 2 On the Step 2 tab, random samples have been taken from the population data chosen during Step 1. Here, the user may manipulate the sample size drawn from each population.\nThis tab also introduces the assumptions of the ANOVA test. Depending on the sample size and population data selected on the previous tab, users are told whether or not the assumptions have been met.\nThe random samples are displayed graphically on this tab as boxplots. Users may interact with the graph to visulaize the boxplots in full, a visual representation of the within groups variances of the samples, or a visual representation of the between groups variance of the samples. The relevance of these variances are explored further during the next step.\nStep 3 The Step 3 tab is concerned with reviewing the conclusion made by the ANOVA test on the population data selected by users during Step 1. Before receiving the conclusion, users are reminded of the hypotheses examined by ANOVA.\nUnder the \u0026ldquo;What is the F-statistic\u0026rdquo; section users are introduced to the F-stat, its relationship to the within groups and between groups variances visualized on the \u0026ldquo;Step 2\u0026rdquo; tab, and how it is used by ANOVA to reach the conclusion. Once again, the random samples from Step 2, are displayed graphically as boxplots for reference.\nFinally, the conclusion of the ANOVA test is presented. It is put in terms of the hypotheses users have examined, but users are also provided with a copy of the ANOVA test output they would expect were they to conduct the same test using the R programming language.\nResources Page This next tab provids users with a copy of some equations relevant to ANOVA. This page also gives more insight into how to interpret the ANVOA test output from R encountered during Step 3.\nAssesment Page This final tab provides a short quiz for users to practice running an ANOVA test in R snd review some of the concepts touched on throughout the app.\n The Exploring ANOVA app was created by Samantha Owusu-Antwi for Duke University\u0026rsquo;s Creating Interactive Learning Tools Project, Summer 2020.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1daccb7a8c10e99697e935b73d9bd38e","permalink":"/project/anova/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/anova/","section":"project","summary":"Learn more about the ANOVA test process including which assumptions the test makes and the meaning behind the test conclusion.","tags":["regression"],"title":"Exploring ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"To start, click on \u0026lsquo;See the app!\u0026rsquo; above: Outliers are not an easy topic to learn, but we\u0026rsquo;ll keep it simple here—we promise.

Identify Outliers: Click on the checkboxes to include and exclude outliers from the model. See how the regression line and coefficients change.\n2. Measure Outliers: Click on each of the three measures to see easy-to-understand definitions and formulas.

Hypothesis testing is a reliable way to take sample data and test how strongly its evidence supports our new claim \u0026ndash; if the evidence is strong, we can reject the old beliefs and support the new; if it is weak, we cannot reject the old beliefs.\nThis app will allow you to explore hypothesis testing from beginning to end, giving you skills to:\n Identify appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for a problem scenario, and effectively interpret test conclusions in terms of the hypotheses/practical scenario. Properly calculate and interpret test statistic, p-value, and alpha level, and understand how to use them to make a conclusion. Understand how sample size can affect test statistic and p-value. Correctly define and interpret Type I and Type II errors, and calculate their probabilities, given various parameters such as alpha, sample size, and testing power. Understand the conditions/assumptions under which each type of error may occur.  Instructions For the best experience with the Hypothesis Testing App, try following these steps:\n Check out the Overview page for a big-picture look at hypothesis testing, as well as the introduction of our running example and other small tips about the app\u0026rsquo;s functionality. Head to the Null/Alternative Hypotheses page to see the interactive sidebar and choose your parameters for your hypothesis test. Then, read about how the hypotheses are formed, and view the distributions graphically! Next, visit the Test Statistic/P-Value page to explore how to calculate the hypothesis test results, compare values to make a conclusion, and observe your results on a plot. Then, you can look at the Type I/Type II Error tab for an explanation of the kinds of errors that can occur in hypothesis tests and how to reduce them. Finally, take a quiz on the Quiz tab to test your knowledge and see if you\u0026rsquo;re a hypothesis test expert! Visit the Resources tab for some further reading if you\u0026rsquo;re interested.  You can reset parameters and re-run the hypothesis simulation at any time, so be sure to try out different scenarios to see what happens!\nCreated by Abbey List for the ShinyEd project at Duke University, Summer 2020.
